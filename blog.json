I wanted to add an internal messaging service for the users. I stumbled upon <a href=\"http://django-postman.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\">postman</a> and thought it would be good to try to integrate an app someone else made into my project. I'd never done this before but after a few tweaks of the URLs, base.html, and settings.py file it was kind of working. Some friends recommended that I make it myself but after having a look at it I thought it was nearly impossible. Granted, I could probably make a simple version but why spend my time making one when there already is something out there? There can be benefits to starting from scratch for practice or customization but there is also a need to practice working with and integrating other code into your own. After fiddling with this app and running into some problems, I have realized that playing around with it will teach me more than what I could learn by making my own app. I'm being exposed to new techniques and tricks I wouldn't have even thought of myself. I'm also running into a lot of problems I wouldn't have if I made my own app.</p>\r\n<p>So, although the title of this post is Work Smart Not Hard, it still takes a lot of work using someone else's code. I was so impressed with some front end project my friend was working on until I realized it was mostly borrowed from other resources. Then I was reminded that it's not all copy and paste. It takes a lot of understanding, knowledge and practice to efficiently and quickly integrate an already developed project into your own. And as a friend recently reminded me, when starting a at a new company most projects are continuations and aren't starting from scratch. So it's very important to work with and understand other people's code.</p>\r\n<p>I wanted to write this post because I felt like I had to justify using this app, but I don't need to because it's awesome. So I wanted to let everyone else know not to feel guilty about using whatever resources you can. It's an awesome app with all the services you could need from a messaging app. If you're interested in setting it up on your django project, I recommend checking out the <a href=\"http://django-postman.readthedocs.org/en/latest/quickstart.html\">quick set up</a>.</p>\r\n<h5>Open source is awesome to use and to learn from, so use it!</h5>", "created_date": "2016-02-12T08:30:06Z", "published_date": "2016-02-12T08:30:44Z", "img": "./postman_1.png"}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 5, "fields": {"author": 1, "title": "Open Source Contributing", "text": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>\"Rachell's story is so impressive!

This awesome community has kept me so busy but also so motivated to excel and help those around me. To be brief, the Django Girls Seoul community started as a workshop but now has turned into a community that hosts movie screenings and holds free code camps as well as study meet-ups to inspire and support women in their programming journey.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CKUhptMfk94/VjKbkmAHa6I/AAAAAAAAItk/edpm1ueNOYE/s1600/event.png\" alt=\"Django Girls Seoul\" width=\"651\" height=\"199\" /></p>\r\n<p><br />After our first workshop, I wrote a blog post about my journey into programming and why I decided to start Django Girls Seoul. The above quote was in reference to that post. I lead with that quote because it's the reason I contribute my time, energy and any skills I have to help make this community better. I want to give these awesome women a chance at employment, upward mobility, equality, and the future.<br />Programming is pretty new to me as well, that's why I can relate to our workshop and code camp attendees. I have been enjoyably uncomfortable every step of the way and one of those steps was contributing to an open source project for the first time. As an \"early \" programmer it's hard to know when you have the skills and are ready for contributing to someone else's project or collaborating with a team but I learned quickly that \"done is better than perfect\". If you keep waiting until you're ready, you'll never take risks or try new things. <br />&nbsp;Collaborating and contributing to an open source project has many advantages.&nbsp; After reading these kinds of articles and talking with people in the industry, I realized how beneficial contributing to open source would be to improving my skills, creating an on-line presence, networking and being part of something I'm passionate about.</p>\r\n<p><br /><span style=\"font-size: large;\">First PR</span></p>\r\n<p><br />I got involved in my first open source project, Code for Everyone in October of 2015. This project was to create a website to connect like-minded people, help them learn to code but also invite people to teach and share their knowledge via lectures and study meet-ups. We used Python and Django for back-end and Material Design Lite, HTML and CSS for front-end. I had only done a couple of tutorials on Django so I wasn't very confident in my ability to contribute but I still tried. I was assigned the task of creating an RSVP list to see who had signed up to attend X event. I had some problems in my code but with a few helpful comments later I was able to get my PR merged. I also contributed to the design of the page like editing the content of the page and adjusting the footer spacing and position of the \"source\" button.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/CodeforeveryoneSeoul/codeforeveryone/blob/master/landingsite/static/landingsite/images/logo_jin_1.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Code For Everyone\" width=\"600\" height=\"139\" /></p>\r\n<p><br />So my first open source project on a community programming IT group, Code for Everyone, was mostly for me to get my footing in the contributing, open source world but also to get more exposure and practice with more complex code. After I had a successful merge, I felt awesome. I felt like this thing I thought would be nearly impossible for me, no longer was. I broke through my self-imposed limitations that I had on my programming ability, gaining confidence and knowledge along the way. So I was ready to do it again.</p>\r\n<p><br /><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Django Girls Code Camp Site</span></p>\r\n<p><br />My next contribution was during the first ever Django Girls Code Camp. We had to create a curriculum so I added some practice problems as well as some solutions to the curriculum GitHub repository. The code camp attendees worked on these problem while learning Python. It was a good review for&nbsp; me as well to create them. During the code camp we had regular 'code alongs' to work through some of the practice problems as a group.</p>\r\n<p><br /><img title=\"Django Girls Seoul\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fhvbbcbdqsg5qaNSQ0mYUHM4nAE6AftU5BxAGohOosoTV7QhUSDQZzU6LKvx6OXZIP88hKRZjKIgJpmoKrN4BrF_R1doEV6_IrADjVjC_WZm_yo2-xUC9gSO4TmJh0Hyt2kGpJP9vR5wm_O0kRu24H-WOVqlk3n9AD0ft2Ij5pJoH8ks0kWErG5hDoIHFbEo-p4Yymuua127LvV8tHCP52zH4TZ0HnykL2PhqHWL4HjjQiGLNTDmkc51AJfvP897zDQb4BkuaAU8FOL1kHzwYlG-gknz_3cJ7CiV0_2zA8pflsfllPpk5pxRQQoHOjV_MoFvW72wVyRJTmr9jRYyNhb7hG3zUCpjQn4WNtOTOcPXHI2nS3N8JRAa-tHDCSvEGdrswmBi9sSPwVvIYG7PmWxATMg6XSZcQxnZFfyPckyBZaGFZA5g0pqfYuyllXNzyLmqtOXnayqzCXcXmEtS5Y05TrVUYq1Gd_J1AzVy7AVGomoUmzQ0u3nsx0R9KwOPMNQA_oOIXXhhyDNOwqizpejTpQfi5_zVaBye431MZP0=w1001-h667-no\" alt=\"Django Girls Seoul \" width=\"725\" height=\"513\" /></p>\r\n<p><br />Some of the&nbsp; Django Girls Seoul attendees have been participating regularly from the beginning and are still active in a second project based code camp. Our community needed to have a website to describe our curriculum, introduce our volunteers and most importantly show off our members' final projects. So my next chance to contribute was on the Django Girls Code Camp site. I edited content and added curriculum to the site. I also added coaches photos and links to their personal site or social media. I created a showcase section on the page to show off our members hard work! I added all of our social media, resources and statistics to the footer. Lastly, I added a section to show our collaborative work and non-profit projects. I wanted other members of our group to benefit from open source projects so I started a non-profit project to remake the&nbsp;&nbsp; The Light and Leadership Initiative site. Our members will help contribute to our&nbsp; open source project to improve our skills and to help others.</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" title=\"Django Girls Seoul Site\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/l7I_erFvTDt8dDDjL7NCM5H_SZK-MoA0HviVTILylCpFiWBUaVuvluXYpisdmSBB2Zpku5ymhI080PFlpn7sCsykFn901hAunfk6hNYs47Wg-HFeYKe7CGv9rk6PQhRWyFhzilEnujYgdpxTd7fVQxK3bQgeOqnIPDAIRbzpuAL6jNCKqZTaOIKx0A71ACFDGr0_VPXz3xvhU_NYMmKSXueVTyz_OC4o-C3OIK_Hs7gdM4W5pD9g__WXPYXqu4uIonN76DHUcNwcp_J7yDVKfvlmL6T5lclF-wDk7HY9svQJjH_EACS1XmKdoJaQS2N1Sf7Pe4qs1YAqOwAOFB_2KV65IfxR3pwFRbHJ6Lz6daNuFDgVGcM024u1y-Z_uCCHrT9WmLqu5TvpzYThEdwFS2V5929EkFh0cnpoDfut1id-A4HyYAn5xYktnmKrA7XdkzJjwhdntQQ4eILE8-8_zDteyVG8DnL3X2RX9pkZyfNclmD2fbA5V2ESS9Z6qZtNGJKjCmUVm0AlcdT66Zk5mwZgvRKPHTX2p6TKArwRxLrU2ie43-YyNuCvmAAuPuOg2wSE=w972-h547-no\" alt=\"Django Girls Seoul Site\" width=\"756\" height=\"425\" /></p>\r\n<p><br />The site makes it easier to find information for the code camp such as coaches information, curriculum,contact information, and resources.&nbsp; Because we have this site, our ability to communicate, disperse information, and market our program to potential sponsors has also improved.Another important feature is to show how successful our members have been by showcasing their work. It is also a great opportunity to give our members attention from potential future employers, hopefully helping them land a job.</p>\r\n<p><br /><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Why Contribute to Open Source?</span></p>\r\n<p><br />Contributing to these projects has brought and will bring many benefits for me, other community members and the other contributors. It has given me experience working with other people's code. Before contributing, I had only worked on my own projects but now I am getting experience collaborating, working on other peoples' code, but also being sure to write code that follows industry standards and that's readable. It's also important to get positive criticism and be able to edit my code appropriately.</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" title=\"github help\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ssxUC6au6DdHFwy9SbybYPoG4Ky4eX5Bo5EygHsHppohRTc58GBk13l5fqm4ZNzYKVtSDodiPU7sixNoKS-O5CK43jDwT0ywN-DEuNOe7jMjM5Dp9uzBNqy68bOoQXuGi_ZOWG4S8oz3o53qSGVumswnoHOg6Ix1E26gizhix7tniBlJ7o7xZYw0WfOfz-nidcZhUdcLDPrMEgI9tPVST23LRY0Hv2eYz7cIEmbcL1UQBNz4g0P76ymWuWNBMXkZW1XcmrqvQXxepAmtmix1usD1TTJfy0hNVxbMHrN-ibkxG6ZyMNzFn68NwtIs-L9W-9D4uXxwUQc7fV7y3zGleqpA4tj_c6LxPOs9rOwSWRCrc_4nHxkimMK0vUW4DCSjvi2cco4TuWkG-yoW37dWAKqHE-G2mLMdzTTSjtpukQtHZIVUsuhUiQqIzPlV6m6hZlsNxkANuFbvzpwPHMoEBp-U8rKtii78y0QMox4uSh6eY1NU-J5KQy_j-Vh64RvXg0qJgaiLCpOkO4RQTllVGl98vQK7YZ8ZyQZ09gTHzHLa6f6cmkIGFLLlYTanF_QJ9rRy=w945-h603-no\" alt=\"github help\" width=\"761\" height=\"504\" /><br /><br />Contributing on these projects has given me platform to show my work that is widely used in the industry. I know that many IT companies look at their applicants GitHub accounts to see the quality of their code and how actively they collaborate, so having a portfolio of projects that I've contributed to will hopefully help in my future employment opportunities.<br />Lastly, contributing has also provided a chance to meet other people in the field, be it as a mentor, friend or potential employer. While working on this project I got a chance to work with more complex code than I would have been able to do, but I also got help to understand it. Some people are generous enough to help me work through a problem I'm having, becoming a type of mentor. Having someone, other than Google or Stack Overflow, to go to with questions is crucial while working through some difficult code or project.</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" title=\"github help2\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zrhMAxtmIftUIwve3M7HFgGnMzZCpCZWz32Uw5B-KAfHPeGMo-suXKdJcConID46gp6tIFWXHkyHUJAS7MF6OFOvsmpmccm5SbQOUeQwa7OA1ZJSpBZddfyNgbYQH_s9c9Vttgr2HO8H2tLTSnW47YgkDtiKRrMalnM2xi7hx_LmtausG_rYTRdvVCNPVHq1P8zTc2qYRvcewJbZLAMQFU2csBbRhgY8lJlQN6OlLOvKnyoNphesg4Fq62cTDh3b5nyQOAMUemMApQYwY9ZCPro0nE5Jz-DaYMZ9x2rmGaTv-YmRR2Qn_tnnb1OH-P7IAd9ht27o-xxaxcvDdUFePovi2JG93pOaQEicLOos0B191GTkw5feXHyNfakR44AwTp3o99JJogKV4Zq-3VqetSOLuGFQulLLNYwEjJa2Sx8tyBjBZpfRxaz_YGpboc60Kr7L-B9m_Q_g0RCq-h2xscubpN2s6BQ7GHFWMpOt07_tl_x0-H8lcUEdCkAOKvKoWWWj5ZF7AeaeEYS09ZqMgEbsAz7y_eziuAnNt0NPRHaRXPBC8oLhydtFogeGacbYfhWz=w789-h249-no\" alt=\"github help2\" width=\"789\" height=\"249\" /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: large;\">The Future</span></p>\r\n<p><br />When I first started programming it was as a hobby, but recently I've decided to make a career change from EFL teacher to full-stack web developer. My goals for the next year are to master the front-end side of things while still working on back-end with Django and Python. I plan to increase my portfolio by working on as many different kinds of projects that I can. Recently, I've been doing Udacity's front-end responsive design courses and working toward mastering JavaScript. I am hoping to complete the front end nano-degree from Udacity but because it is a bit expensive I've been working on the courses and projects on my own. These course projects coupled with my open source contributions will get me one step closer to my goal.<br />If you have a chance to contribute to an open source project, I encourage it. I write this to tell my story, to let people know it's not as scary as it seems, and regardless of programming ability anyone can contribute. I encourage all the Django Girls out there , as well as anyone else reading to give it a try! There are so many different projects out there that it won't be hard to find one you are passionate about.

I could write the whole post about how beautiful Budapest is but I'll save it for another time.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The theme was Jazz and Saxaphones and the organizers made sure everything followed suit, even the tweets. On March 29th I volunteered as a coach for Django Girls Budapest, which was a great event itself and my first time stepping into the role of Django Girls Coach instead of organizer. I had a blast!</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The talks started from March 30 and finished up April 1st with two days of sprints following.

The first surprise was that the conference organizers set up a slack channel for all attendees. This was my first conference so I couldn't really compare much but I loved being able to ask about public transit, hotels etc. Everyone attending would have similar concerns or questions so it was a convenient way to communicate. The channel was used before, during, and after the event for questions or follow-up.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The organizers made such a successful effor to include everyone and make all attendees feel comfortable. There were vegan and vegetarian food options and care baskets in the bathrooms covering almost any emergency one could image. There were positive posters all around, designated people available to talk to for any problems that might occur of if someone felt uncomfortable. I never felt uncomfortable or needed most of these services but it was reassuring knowing they were available.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/w1VagKXcgkdKaiQtf7oUgTY_0unfu3PAgyBox6uHXi5Tr98KIFs43XdOhpOuMzf02qjYEM4DQyhDVWcYfWVPkCKG5Bhx_KSHIwKuK76Vg-yCyrWTgemf0wfoPuvSF3Gi7LwaY_yDbJOz-ku312Xqb1p3P5LUbeI-aNn-pSAMj8n5Hr9S1Xq7L2DtXzU2rTrJugtmhZlq6_IxQR3uWbO7H92uDdvPCED34E3oMlNbwOXPEUyTAkbrxigHneCzdcz9S2F4iroPLbflU4LGxtSRZ7mheCGzDAF-Z-iAKp7z4WF1H-QQ-ZlVToaaS_60GRtJ3rWKPFqjxiHMmx0AaFVXvDlAbQTEJ38bkVQLrx_r4knWGEp9OoA-4n2T2R5ZZqdC-K37xzmROyLyWhAD-qOfK5E_31f2KYVqL4APJ6iaFPpDTsJ3PfgDXAro0KP8mJsEOxqGz2b3IQBWJx7FSWn8wTBHX3php8BIImpFZnbCT4R7q6XpTMyRezVqnTLXTJORmhxYwVG1UZzwtmlgLYFFklL3Kcn1qAbZJi0IipG_67Ecu79nKC-eqhEmLYvo16gVLR6yb_ldW4kgV5hLjV3iQj-sWluO1SI=w640-h426-no\" alt=\"goodies\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: large;\">The Goodies</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">You can see in the picture we got some high quality, well designed goodies, including some awesome socks with saxaphones on them!

Some talks were a bit over my head but I could still follow along. I was surprised that some of the talks were actually things I was familiar with. The nice mix of different topics and styles made the sitting and listening for such long periods of time enjoyable. I took a lot of notes, so many notes! But finding the time to go back and do this tutorial or use this resource is difficult, because there were just Too. Much. Awesomeness!</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">You can watch all the talks <a href=\"https://opbeat.com/events/djangocon-eu-2016/\">here</a>!</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">The Sprints and Workshops</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">I enthusiastically signed up for a lot of workshops, but I was late to my first one and the Wifi wasn't working well. That added to my exhaustion of three days of talks and small talk I called it quits. I went back for the second day and the wifi was working again, YAY!

Luckily, I knew a handful of people through Django Girls but I was excited to finally put faces to names and catch up with people I had just been emailing with or stalking on twitter. The coffee breaks between talks were surprisingly exhausting, even for the excessive talker and outgoing person that I am. Even through the exhausting small talks, it was still nice to chat with diverse people, with various skills and backgrounds.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">I was shocked when another first time attendee asked me how long it took for me to feel comfortable with my programming skills like I was a pro. Took?! It made me realize that we are all more similar than different with our struggles and challenges in different areas. I also saw other attendees in a different light. What used to feel like 'us and them' suddenly became a united 'us'.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">The talks and community were so impressive, inspring and motivational that I decided to give it a try and sumit a proposal for DjangoCon US 2016. I was accepted and I wouldn't have been without the support and inclusiveness of the Django community.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Photos by Bartek Pawlik</p>", "created_date": "2016-05-24T04:47:29Z", "published_date": "2016-05-24T06:46:00Z", "img": "./26360062246_45c2d8c428_z.jpg"}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 9, "fields": {"author": 1, "title": "Django Girls Seoul Workshop #2", "text": "<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 24px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">Community</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">One thing that sets </span><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"http://www.djangogirlsseoul.org/\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #1155cc; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Django Girls Seoul</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"> apart from the others is our community.

Because we have some good networks in Seoul and gracious sponsors, we decided to have a two day event to help lighten the pressure and reassure the attendees it's not a 'One Day Workshop', but rather their first day joining our community. If we had known before the workshop all the interest it would create, we probably would have better prepared and scheduled follow-up events earlier so we could inform the attendees during the workshop. We came to find out recently that many coaches and attendees weren't even aware that we continued to meet regularly after the first workshop.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: center;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.333333333333332px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/15D5D6U_twZprJWmh103tr3CFvax8qaf8xVCQT_7KzyjLVeHzDcYrCu6X5kd_4Y3XMkS5GfYcnkddYgLjbuspjj6lhbwCODuo48vWu8K4oijqp-6zjGG1bgf17kUQnK_oWMwqWA3\" alt=\"html css python\" width=\"602\" height=\"401\" /></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: center;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.333333333333332px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">Asella Choi giving tips of what to learn next.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">So it was decided that Django Girls Seoul Workshop #2 was on June 4th, 2016 from 10:00 - 6pm at Microsoft's office hall and our \"Extended Tutorial Workshop\" would be on June 18th from 1:00 to 6:00 at </span><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"http://dcamp.kr/about_en\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #1155cc; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">D.Camp</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">.

Many people put in a lot of hours but then suddenly with an update to the English Version, the Korean version went from 100% finished to 20%.

The tutorial usually uses a different deployment service but thanks to MS, all of our attendees and coaches were able to try Azure. Our team of organizers created a small tutorial to help fit in with our Django Girls tutorial and after signing up everything went smoothly. It's a great service for beginners because after any changes on the git repository, the deployment will be automatic. As a beginner, jumping into web development can be difficult and confusing with all the new languages so we appreciate any service that can make it easier.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 24px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">New Faces</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">Since last year our community has grown and we want it to keep growing, but we are all aware of the toll over-committing can take. We decided to shake things up and add new organizers to the mix. The main reasons were to replace two organizers that are leaving and to support the ones that remain. We are trying to avoid burn-out, add some fresh ideas, increase more community involvement, build leadership and maintain the energy to keep our community going for a long time. This workshop we had 5 new organizers and three from last year to reach a total of 8. The two that stepped down took on the official role of coach, but still helped a lot during the organizing period.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.333333333333332px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 100%;\" title=\"Organizers\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/O9_rd5nkndaRCCW1SfqVfhX9Ybt-CIdRvs8BRxe2eo6Hxce3mo94uPoTxe0EUI9ckYBBvWjGQcycy-0T_7uxgCVxwYB2uxVGEHC3tSnqmOO1zK6Yq9g7ZLVQmFGJZiJo6LUC1PB3\" alt=\"Organizers\" width=\"602\" height=\"327\" /></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">We tried to give each organizer a clear task. Some of those include: coach management and training, translating the tutorial, catering services, printed materials, lightning talks, and communication with applicants, sponsors and venue. With more organizers and volunteers it was difficult to make sure everyone was on the same page all the time, but in the end everything worked out perfectly and I am so thankful for the extra help this time.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: center;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.333333333333332px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 100%;\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/g3FWbMiZNGTlJVLjXaywN2b77BfkW7ZcJfZ5ITHUL2WC4-lx-DlHuGCeJj2mDAhh9ul5EBDZC7B7Mf43ddx_QdvLiQNT-wCxFDGtY-4dqCNFSwBKDgW3zfG82V5bSFKcl-jgRIXz\" alt=\"Organizers meeting\" width=\"602\" height=\"401\" /></span><span style=\"font-size: 13.333333333333332px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"> The organizers are working hard planning and preparing for the workshop.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 24px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">Coaches &amp; Coach meeting</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">Before each workshop we think it's important to have a coaches meeting because even if we email the </span><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"http://coach.djangogirls.org/\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #1155cc; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Django Girls Coaches Manual</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">, chances are that most people won't read it. If they did read it, it's still good to have a coaches meeting to not just tell them how we want to run the workshop but to show them with our enthusiasm and energy. Because of the short time to prepare and train coaches we tried to recruit members in our network, such as coaches from last year. We ended up with 7 new coaches, 2 two of them were actually attendees at the workshop last year, and the rest were all repeat coaches.

One idea we used from last year was to put a clapper on each table for the coach to use when an attendee had successfully installed something, got their site on-line, or fixed a bug. Most of the coaches already knew about the style of our workshop so naturally things fell into place once we put the clappers on the tables.

He was able to give me some tips to get me started and actually got a job offer because of some of the work on that project. It was setting up a server, use an API and manipulate an API, work with a mongodb and run tests to see if your code passes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Day 2: </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;The second chat we had was the typical get to know eachother and set goals. He recommended choosing a project and gave me some ideas that other people had done. I'll go back about a month to when I first got an idea for something I wanted to make. I was at a meeting for my city's refugee council, a council that meets regularly to try to set up better services and organize the community to help with the influx of refugees. One thing that the organization struggles with is that they have no place to store donations. One person at the meeting mentioned that he wanted to make a database that people could list their donation and when someone else visits the site they can list what they need and if the items match their contact info could be shared. There are some concerns over who could be a user and who could donate/request donations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The person who recomennded this was going to use PHP but I thought this would be a good idea for my toptal project, and if it works out they could use it. So I decided I wanted to make that for my project.</p>\r\n<p>Day 3:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Starting with Angular:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Since I have never touched angular before, we set up a simple hello world app and the user inputs their name. I was amazed at how perfectly the output came right on the page without a refresh. I sound like I've never touched a computer before, but after working with python, django and basic front end (html/css/bootstrap), where if we want to see updated info we have to refresh, I was pleasantly surprised at this new tool I'm adding to my toolbelt. Day three was mostly getting a feel for Angular.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>My homework this day was to set up the basic backend for my app. I decided to use django because that's what I know, but also it will be useful when it's passed to a refugee-affiliated organization because any non-programmer will be able to easiliy manage site via django-admin page.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Day 4:</span></p>\r\n<p>I had my basic django models set up but wasn't sure how to connect them to angular.</p>\r\n<p>So the refugee donate app has(will probably change a lot but this was the main idea):</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Users:</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>login/logout</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<li>Profile:</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>username(foreign key from users)</li>\r\n<li>organization(if applicable)&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<li>Contact Method</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>user(foreign key from userprofiles)</li>\r\n<li>phone number</li>\r\n<li>email</li>\r\n<li>prefered contact method(choice)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<li>Donations that have fields of :&nbsp;</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>items</li>\r\n<li>details</li>\r\n<li>condition(choices)</li>\r\n<li>location</li>\r\n<li>published date</li>\r\n<li>user(foreign key)</li>\r\n<li>category(foreign key)</li>\r\n<li>subcategory(foreign key)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<li>Requests</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>item</li>\r\n<li>location</li>\r\n<li>published date</li>\r\n<li>details</li>\r\n<li>contact method(foreign key from profile)</li>\r\n<li>user(foreign key)</li>\r\n<li>category(foreign key)</li>\r\n<li>subcategory(foreign key)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<li>Category</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>order</li>\r\n<li>title</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<li>Subcategory</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>order</li>\r\n<li>title</li>\r\n<li>link</li>\r\n<li>category(foreign key to category)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>So for day 4 we incorporated our previously made 'hello world' app into my new django 'donate' app. We got it working so that users will enter their name and email and it will return this info on the page. We also added some donate objects onto the page, with the fields 'items' and 'details'.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>We also realized we will need to use tastypie to help with handling api.
